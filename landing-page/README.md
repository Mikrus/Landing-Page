# Udacity Landing Page 

## Description

This project is meant to be an introductory into JavaScript. 
The goal of this project was to convert a static landing page into a dynamic one.
When clicking on one of the listed sections in our navbar, it would scroll the user down the page to the correlated section.
Lastly, user can understand what section they are on because whichever section they are actively on will be highlighted in the navbar.
